# StatusIQ-iOS-SDK
Mobile applications help business services ensure a continuous interaction with customers and enable customers to access their services anytime, from any location. But when availability issues strike, the user experience is often hampered. By providing timely updates regarding the outage or the recovery process, customers are kept in the loop thereby making the process transparent.

With a public status page, like StatusIQ, you can post real-time updates to keep your customers updated on your active incidents or scheduled maintenance, publish postmortem reports, and more. Integrate your mobile applications with StatusIQ and help users track service status updates. 

The StatusIQ iOS SDK (StatusIQFramework) is a free module for StatusIQ. The perk is that you can integrate the StatusIQ iOS SDK with your business's mobile iOS app and showcase the service's availability. We've created a Status iOS Pod which contains the StatusIQ iOS framework. Businesses using the StatusIQ product can now integrate the Status iOS Pod in their business apps to showcase their real-time service status to clients. The integration also provides various customization options, like changing the font, color customization, and navigation.
